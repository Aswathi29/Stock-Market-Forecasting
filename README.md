# Stock-Market-Forecasting

In this project i have collected the data from a stock Market site.
Using Beautiful Soup and Request Librabry i scraped the Stock Market data of Gold . Then using Linear regression model and SARIIMA model , i predicted the future price of Gold.

SARIIMA model was used because on plotting , it was clear that the data set was stationary.

On checking the accuracy the Linear regression model had better accuracy than SARIIMA model.
